# lostinpatterns' dotfiles

Pieced together from various other people's dotfiles. This is very much a work in progress.

## Installation

Super easy:

```terminal
git clone git://github.com/lostinpatterns/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles && rake install
```

The install script will look for `~/.extra`
